# First Post!

Welcome to my Blog!

The theme for the blog will be to document my journey with Fastai and the space of AI in general.


## Turbulent times 

I have to say i think we are in a really interesting time as programmers.. With the development of AI language models such as ChatGPT it's never been easier to write a piece of code. 

As a matter of fact i think code has become more accessible to everyone, with the use of a prompt you can generate a piece of code that is tailored to the language you choose and its quite helpful for debugging.


## What the Professionals have to say!

The spark for this thought came from a recent episode i watched of the *Lex Fridman Podcast* where Lex had Steven Wolfram on, The man who made **Wolfram Alpha** (bless this man)!

In the episode they discussed the several topics but the most intersting was: *is programming dead?* the two discussed the evolution of language models and how coding is beccoming a skill that no longer has to be learnt before used.

Unlike the two of them i dont have a Phd in robotics, physics or mathematics so a fair bit went over my head but a link to there dicussion can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD353DeOM-4&t=424s&ab_channel=LexClips).


## Blessing or curse?

AI making programming more accessable for all is certainly not a bad thing, but i do like the idea of my job still paying me a decent amount because not everyone can do it.

Jokes aside aslong as we dont create a skynet all is good. That's enough from me, i hope you enjoyed reading this and i thought i'd attach a funny meme on your way out:
