# What's a Bird?

Question 2! the multi classfication problem. it seemed simple enough, I was wrong - very wrong.

## Find my Bird!

to attempt to complete my question 2 i decided to get the notebook *00-what-is-a-bird* working. I felt like this example was simiar enough to what i needed to do for question 2, get images, train a model, tune the model and use this model on our training set. 

In my journey to get this question working little did i know what lurked around the corner, the search errors. 

## .fpx?
using the search function had provided me several errors, the occansional time out, the search function not working because it didn't seem to recognize the search function that was literally defined the line above. Thanks to [this](https://lovellbrian.github.io/2023/05/16/Bug.html) post on brians blog i was able to resolve my issues!

That was until i had reached an error that would plauge me for hours, the .fpx file type error:
