# About

My name is Mayvin Rathod and I am a student at UQ majoring in electrical engineering and Machine learning. I have a blooming interest in ML/AI and electronics.

I began Studying in 2019 and will finish late 2024. I would love to go into the field of health based applications for engineering as i like the idea of helping people.

In my spare time i like to:
  - Play games
  - read books
  - Spend time with my family
  - listen to David Goggins tell me why I can do more
  - Give more affection to my cat then she can handle (her fault for being cute)
